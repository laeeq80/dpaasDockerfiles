# dpaasDockerfiles
The repo is maintained so we can keep all the docker files for the PTPAAS project at one place. Except cpvsUIDocker, all other docker files have their own repo, so here we only explain cpvsUIDoker file.

#CPVSUIDockerFile

The file is used to create Docker image for CPVS UI. It quite simple and adds a basic apache httpd webserver and expose the service on port 80.
